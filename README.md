# QPADM-slack
QPADM-slack algorithm for quantile regression with the SCAD and MCP penalties, which can be used to reproduce the simulation studies in the following paper:

**Ye Fan, Nan Lin and Xianjun Yin**. *Penalized Quantile Regression for Distributed Big Data Using the Slack Variable Representation.*

Two main functions are included: the **QPADMslackCPP( )** and the **QPADMslackDIS( )**, which are for the non-distributed and distributed environments, respectively.
